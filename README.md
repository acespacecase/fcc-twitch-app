# fcc-twitch-app
This is part of FreeCodeCamp's curriculum. Requires include: being able to tell which users were online and offline; being able to click a link to be taken to the active stream; view additional information about active streamers (i.e. viewers, preview).

# learning curve
The API was easy once I realized forEach would work better than a for loop. What tripped me up at first was setting up the Bootstrap layout in such a way that any amount of cards could be added to Online or Offline without throwing off the grid. That meant the rows would automatically wrap and fall into the same columns as the ones preceding it. After looking at the documentation, I was able to get it working pretty quickly. Otherwise, this project was very straightforward.

# favorite part
I love that Twitch's API lets you view active previews. You can get some pretty cool information for active streamers.
